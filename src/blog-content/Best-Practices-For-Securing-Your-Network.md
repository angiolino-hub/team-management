## 3. Regular Software Updates

Keep all software and systems up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.

### Automated Updates

Enable automated updates to ensure all systems are consistently updated.

## 4. Use Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access.

### Types of Encryption

- **At-Rest Encryption**: Protects data stored on devices.
- **In-Transit Encryption**: Protects data being transmitted over the network.

## 5. Monitor Network Traffic

Regularly monitor network traffic to identify and respond to suspicious activities.

### Monitoring Tools
